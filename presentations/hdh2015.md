# The Problem Domain

1. the aspect of innovation
2. the sustainability of publications
3. the infrastructure of publications
4. the perception of publications

???

1. **ACM Publishing Plan 1995**: multi-media & supplementary resources, formal semantics, computational reproducibility, open peer-review, continuous versioning â€¦ **features all proposed** already
1. technological advancement and implementations did not lead to situation where these publications are**status quo** 
1. successful projects: Data Papers (not innovative Candela), openEdition are quiet **conservative** regarding their features
2. existence project dependent (myExperiment, Scalar), loose **reproducability or meaning** 
3. These problems comprise **issues of authoring**, rendering, preservation, interoperability or of publications.
4. **Credibility** and Impact

# Aporias of Digital Publishing

- scale
- cohesion
- composition
- secularization
- integrity
- connectivity
- ...

.bc[
- State of Digital Publications
- Aporias of Digital Publications
]

???

- why so
- compare everything under the term in terms of **features and themes** they promote
- we get a very interesting picture of**opposing activities** 

- these activities oppose in:
    - (scale) some publications minimise the **scope** of a publicaton (nano-publication), some maximise it to an objects that **holds the whole research process** (Enhanced Publication)
    - (cohesion): some model publications as **multiply linked resources**, others propos to reduce the narrativity of publications to recorded workflows (Research Objects) 
    - (secularization) some concepts advocate division between **form and content** (Multiformat- or Hybrid Publishing), others promote content through form (Scalar)

- can **go on** with this list

# Publication or Communication?

- what we call publishing is a field of experimentation for scientific meaning making as such
- we do not distinguish very well between publishing and other types of communication

???

- what does this situation **tell aus about** digital publishing?
- it questions that we really **act on the ground of publishing**
- more likely it is a field where every **possible strategy of meaning** making as such is tested out at the moment
- it is about **a communication in general**

# What do we Need?

1. a re-evaluation of the idea of publishing
2. to abondon the idea of digital publishing
3. promoting publishing ecologies
4. a conceptual formal framework of publishing

.bc[
- State of Digital Publications
- Aporias of Digital Publications
- A Multimodal Approach to Publishing
]

???

1. core question: **what is publishing** as communication within communication
    a. not every technological implementation of a publication **may serve as a publication in a socio-cultural and semiotical** sense
2. we should abondan the idea of digital publishing in favor of publishing because the term **digital becomes a damper** - some folks call this post-digital
    a. it leads to two types of **digital essentialisms**: a) real publication **format** b) digital claims on**science** 
3. innovative publishing **does not need new innovative publication objects** but the creation of **innovative publishing ecologies**
4. a **formal framework** is required which make it possible to:
    a. to **harmonise modeling** digital publications in terms of profiles on the ground of comparable **semiotic strategis** and **information structures** they use
    b. to support point 3rd by identifying more clearly**requirements publishing ecologies**

- to work on these issues I **propose** the field of Multimodal Analysis
- MA offers many conceptual **tools** to map and **index semiotic strategies** and **information structures** on a **formal semantic** level
- and to evaluate **how publishing today** relates to **other scientific activities** and to **socio-cultural** contexts
- here we see **system networks** describe what semiotic or grammatical options **resources like text**, images or code hold and how the **applied** in specific information structures

# Publications & Publishing Ecologies

???

- **strata and action diagramms** help to **frame types of communication** within communication as addressed before
- and to frame the **role** of publishing today

- MA is **not considered** much in the field of digital publishing
- however I hope I could **indicate** its usefulness which I am trying apply in my work
