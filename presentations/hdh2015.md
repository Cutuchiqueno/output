- part of PhD Projekt to
    - evaluate state of digital publishing and
    - to define a conceptual framework to better understand and support the creation of digital publications

# The Problem Domain

1. the aspect of innovation
2. the sustainability of publications
3. the infrastructure of publications
4. the perception of publications

.bc[
- State of Digital Publications
]

???

1. **ACM Publishing Plan 1995**: multi-media & supplementary resources, formal semantics, computational reproducibility, open peer-review, continuous versioning …
1. technological advancement and implementations did not lead to situation where these publications are status quo
1. successful projects: Data Papers (not innovative Candela), openEdition are quiet conservative regarding their features
2. existence project dependent (myExperiment, Scalar), loose integrity or meaning
3. These problems comprise issues of authoring, rendering, preservation, integrity, interoperability or of publications.
4. Credibility and Impact

# Aporias of Digital Publishing

- scale
- composition
- secularization
- integrity
- connectivity
- ...

.bc[
- State of Digital Publications
- Aporias of Digital Publications
]

???

- a mapping of this exploration may give hints for the obstacles in digital publishing
- we get a very interesting picture of opposing activities

- these activities oppose in:
    - (sclae) some publications minimise the scope of a publicaton (nano-publication), some maximse them aggregation (Enhanced Publication)
    - (composition) some publications work around a resource as a resource (figshares),  others build on aggregations of resources (SPP)
    - (secularization) some concepts advocate division between form and content (Multiformat- or Hybrid Publishing), others promote content through form (Scalar)
    - and so forth
NOT

    - integrity: decentralizationi (Research Objects) vs packaging (paperMaché)
    - connectivity: decomposition vs multi-dimensional linking (provenance, conceptual, discursive, structural, administratice)

# Publication or Communication?

- what we call publishing is a field of experimentation for scientific meaning making as such
- we do not distinguish very well between publishing and other types of communication

???

- what does this situation **tell aus about** digital publishing?
- it questions that we really **perform on the ground of publishing**
- more likely it is a field where every **possible strategy of meaning** making as such is tested out at the moment
- it is about **acommunication in general**

# What do we Need?

1. a re-evaluation of the idea of publishing
2. to abondon the idea of digital publishing
3. promoting publishing ecologies
4. a conceptual formal framework of publishing

.bc[
- State of Digital Publications
- Aporias of Digital Publications
- A Multimodal Approach to Publishing
]

???

1. core question: **what is publishing** as communication within communication
    a. not every technological implementation of a publication **may serve as a publication in a socio-cultural and semiotical** sense
2. we should abondan the idea of digital publishing in favor of publishing because the term **digital becomes a damper** - some folks call this post-digital
    a. it leads to two types of **digital essentialisms**: a) real publication **format** b) digital claims on**science** 
3. innovative publishing **does not need new innovative publication objects** but the creation of **innovative publishing ecologies**
4. a conceptual formal framework is required which make it possible to:
    a. to **harmonise modeling** digital publications on the ground of similar **semiotic strategis** and **information structures** they use
    b. to support point 4 by identifying more clearly**requirements publishing ecologies**

# Information Structures & Metamodel

???

- to work on these issues I **propose** the field of Multimodal Analysis
- MA offers many conceptual **tools** to map and index semiotic strategies and information structures on a formal semantic level
- and to evaluate **how publishing today** relates to other scientific activities and to socio-cultural contexts
- system networks describe what semiotic or grammatical options resources like text, images or code hold and how the applied in specific information structures

# Publications & Publishing Ecologies

???

- strata and action diagramms help to frame types of communication within communication as addressed before
- and to frame the role of publishing today
- MA is not considered much in the field of digital publishing
- however I hope I could indicate its usefulness which I am trying apply in my work
