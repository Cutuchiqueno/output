		<li>Thus, I would like to really say thank Miha Pece for
		  inviting me to this exciting conference . I would like to
		  thank the organizers make this event possible as well as I
		  would like to thank Miha Serucnik who's kindness and
		  hospitality during my last stay made me feel like coming back
		  to a worm place.</li>
		<li>Now one thing that raised my attention when I read the
		  conference title LTDH is the fact that both areas are
		  addressed seperately from each other. Obviously the Digital
		  Humanities is concerned with Language Technologies. However,
		  there are certainly two communities which would refer
		  themselves more to one or the other. So maybe I am for this
		  moment allowed to say Computer Linguists and Digital
		  Humanists.</li>
		<li>Both communities sometimes challenge each other. Well, I
		  can say that since I am working in the Digital Humanities
		  department of the Academy but as the only one of this
		  department in a whole corridor of computer linguists. Of
		  cause this is a cliche simplification. But for the purpose of
		  todys narrative lets work a little bit with this cliche.</li>
		<li>One of the topic which frequently creates interesting
		  dicussions between computer linguists and digital humanists
		  is the topic annotations. Are annotations metadata to the
		  text or ist it something different? would it be reasonable to
		  distinguish methodoligcally between markup and annotations?
		  (independent from the technological approach). I do not
		  remember in how many occasions I participated in discussions
		  about this topic always with the same set of arguments
		  between Computer Linguists and Digital Humanists.</li>

		<li>In fact also during discussion it became clear that the
		  field of digital annotating has become so dynamic and broad
		  that both interests can not be separated from each other. So

		  The topic of annotations has raised significant interest in

		  years. Many _ESFRI_projects from the Humanities or Social
		  Sciences have worked on annotations in corresponding
		  working packages. With _the pund.it_  _EUROPEANA_ has also
		  built its own annotation tool. PELAGIOS Infrastructure

		</li>
		<li> In the _W3C_ two working groups developed a web compliant

		<li> A traditional way to look at annotations implies a
		  hierarchical relationship between the annotation and the
		  object that is annotated. This relationship is visually well
		  illustrated in medieval glosses which are often arranged
		  around the text in the center of the page. The relationship
		  exists also on the level of production. A book is produced
		  for the main text and gives reason to add annotations 'in the
		  margins'.  </li>
		<li> In definition of the concept of annotations within the
		  Open Annotation Data Model this relationship vanishes. It
		  says: <blockquote>Annotating, the act of creating
		    associations between distinct pieces of
		    information.</blockquote> </li>
		<li> The formal semantics still contain the concept of body and
		  target but technically and methodologically there is no
		  necessary difference in the way Open Annotation understands
		  the relationship between body and target.  </li>

		<li>This has to do with another principle of historical
		  annotations that becomes more and more fragile: the
		  existential dependency of annotations from the annotated
		  object. Annotations exist on the paper of books and
		  vanishes away with it. Digital annotations can be
		  physically stored and disseminated independently. That
		  means annotation data is a primary research output in
		  itself and not solely anymore a documentation of the path
		  that was taken to these results. By using Pelagios,
		  annotations are brought to the level of first class

		<li>@roorda2012annotations addresses this aspect more

		  general does not necessarily mean granular. The body not only
		  the target of annotations can be just a tag but it can also a
		  ten hours movie documentary. General means that it is capable

		<li>Roorda introduces another interesting prospect. In his

		  for queries. In this scenario the annotated object is the
		  volatile entity. The target of the annotation might look
		  differently each time the annotation is rendered. The stable

		  Private or Public, formal or informal, subjective or factual,

	      <li>what needs to be known from annotation contexts so that
		annotation data can be reasonably used elsewhere? In technical
		terms, what are the metadata needs?</li>
	    </ol>

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <ul>
		<li>But how do we catch up on this developments. There are two
		  possibilities to read the overambitious title of this
		  presentation.  The first version asks for the meaning of the
		  landscape itself that is to say what is the meaning of the
		  way this landscape is shaped. For instance, what does the
		  structure of this landscape tell us about the state of
		  annotations in the digital age.  The second version refers to
		  the meaning that is represented in annotations itself and
		  which forms part of this landscape.</li>
		<li>I partially responded to the first question already I will
		  come back on this issue at the end of my talk again.</li>
		<li>The need to systematically approach the second question is
		  the result of another binarity in consequence of the others.
		  Already in the past annotations were often strongly linked to
		  the context of their creation. What digital technologies
		  permit is to extend the contexts in which annotation methods
		  can be applied but also to decontextualize the resulting
		  annotations. So when we speak about publishing and re-use of
		  annotation data we need to assure that this happens in a
		  reasonable and sound way. </li>

		<li><strong>Erläuterung</strong>In this paper I want to
		  introduce a first attempt to systematize the different
		  context dimensions of annotations which were addressed at
		  least partially in the survey before.  For this purpose, I
		  would like to introduce the diagram presented in figure 1.
		</li>
		<li> In the center of the figure there is the annotation which
		  consists of a body and a target. The target addresses both
		  the annotated part of the object as well as the entire
		  object. The body holds the annotation content. The upper half
		  of the figure addresses aspects of practice and semantics
		  while the lower half references aspects of technology and
		  structure. </li>
		<li> Furthermore, a production flow exist from the left to the
		  right in which objects for annotations are created, then
		  annotated and annotations are processed. The left half
		  represents both the production of an object to be annotated
		  and the annotation itself. Likewise, goal and publication can
		  identify corresponding activities which belong to annotations
		  or output for which a peculiar annotation is created.
		  Finally, two types of relationships exist between annotation
		  target and annotation body. Depending on the situation, each
		  dimension can be formally instantiated in a way that
		  expresses its contribution to the overall meaning of peculiar
		  annotation. </li>

		  that such impression might have been created. However, in the

		<li>In which respects is this so?</li>
		<li>Well first, of cause certain type of annotation practice do
		  not require information in specific dimensions. Collaborative
		  Markup for qualitative text interpretation in projects like
		  heureCLèa can not and do not even want to offer a synthetic
		  definition of the semantics in use.</li>
		<li>Than there are annotation practices like using
		  annotations for the semantic alignment of data published in
		  Bioinformatics which are socially stable and settled
		  practices. It would kind of pathetic to describe some of its
		  context dimensions because the practice itself is kind of
		  common and thereby what you might call tacit knowledge.</li>
		<li>Finally, informations of context dimensions can be embedded
		  in the infrastructure. A simple example could eventually be
		  given by the Video Archive of Anthropological films and research
		  footage. Already the name of this infrastructure addresses
		  the methodological context of these types of annotations. But
		  also beyond that – what an infrastructure anables or
		  restricts is an information about how it perceives the
		  content for which it was build. In principle this is a
		  Foucault like argument but not meant critically.

	      <h1>An Environmental Approach to Interoperability</h1>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>interoperability is not just formal semantics, it is also
		  processes, human actions and shared understanding</li>
		<li>interoperability should be designed more by strategic
		  publishing and communication goals of researchers</li>
	      </ul>

	      <aside class="notes">
		<li>Thus the information needs of researchers and even of
		  computers do not always require technically serialized formal
		  semantics. This does not invalidate the whole approach I have
		  presented here. The innovations and ubiquity of annotations
		  demand create a holistic approach. However, the complexity
		  such an approach creates demands to become pragmatic again.
		  Butthe crucial point is, what pragmatic means. If we put the
		  whole topic into the frame of semantic interoperability which
		  it partially is than there are there 2 approaches: the Dublin
		  Core and the CIDOC approach. The first defines pragmatic in
		  terms of finding the lowest common semantic denominator to
		  create a global space of interoperability. The second defines
		  pragmatic from the perspective of the researcher or
		  publisher. He or she decides what to make formally explicit
		  and how to align to the CIDOC reference model. Thus the
		  process of making something semantically interoperable is
		  guided by pragmatic decisions in relation to the environment
		  the researcher address and his or her communicatve
		  goals.</li>
		<li>Disciplines like Computer Science and Informations often
		  focus on the first approach. However, as Humanist Researchers
		  and corresponding to the complexity of the annotation topic
		  we should develop further the second one. And discussions
		  that are taking place at the moment under the terms of
		  Minimal Computing or Post-Digitality show that this approach
		  is in fact becoming more influentila on a broader scale.</li>
		<li>In this respect the systematology is not just meant to
		  create more transparent metadata around annotation data. It
		  was also created to be a conceptual tool for a better
		  understanding of current annotation practices, a more
		  efficient design of annotation data publication scenarios and
		  a context aware use of published annotation data.</li>

	    <h1>What's the Meaning of Digital Annotations</h1>
	    <ul>
		<li>we will find out the methodological meaning by describing
		  annotation scenarios in a way that is informed by this or
		  other systematologies on the level of technology, practice
		  and semantics</li>
		<li>comparable efforts take place in the context of the Digital
		Methods and Practices Observatory (DiMPO) and the Scholarly
		Domain Model (SDM)</li>
	    </ul>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      <ul class="notes">
		<li>Well, descriptions like the ones we gathered in the survey
		  give a first impression. And a systematic analzsis which
		  makes use of the presented systematology which is applied to
		  the levels of technology, practice and semantics could lead
		  to a structured overview annotation scenarios. Actually,
		  there are some activities around the NeDiMAH Method Ontology
		  and the Scholarly Domain Model which are already doing
		  comparable things. So, this will help us to answer to the
		  question what it means to annotate digitally.</li>

	    <h1>Decoupling of Annotation Data</h1>
	    <ul>
	    	<li>not only does annotating extend its scope of application …</li>
		<li>… also annotation data is able to decouple more and more
		  from the methodological frame of its creation</li>
	    </ul>

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <ul>
		<li>The second answer to this question I partially gave already
		  at the beginning. Annotations appear everywhere because due
		  to digital Technologies Annotating is more and more decoupled
		  from few relatively stable positions on vectors between the
		  aforementioned binaries (private/public; static/dynamic;
		  hierarchical/horizontal …).</li>
		<li>But the ubiquity of annotations does not only mean that
		  annotating may be applied everywhere. It means above all, that
		  annotations which are produced in one environment maybe transfered
		  more easily into other environments than before. This can be
		  epistemologically confusing because by this transfer their
		  position on the aforementioned vectors changes which means
		  that also expectations and readings of the same data changes.
		  Personal annotations can be published and accessible for
		  anyone, situational annotations can be archived, annotations
		  can be viewed and analyzed independently from their targets,
		  informal semantics in annotations can be aligned to formal
		  vocabularies by other agents and so forth</li>

	      <h1>Annotations, the Epitome of Scientific
		Knowledge Work With Digital Technologies</h1>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>today, digital annotating relates to any type of knowledge
		and knowledgwork in science</li>
	      <li>they thereby give an example for how digital technologies tone
	      down distinctions that were once more categorial</li>
	      </ul>

	      <aside class="notes">
		<ul>
		  <li>Having all this said, Annotations are so interesting
		    today because they may represent any type of knowledge and
		    can be used in any type of knowledge work. The state of
		    digital annotating increasingly demonstrates the
		    permeability and composability of what was once called
		    knowledge cultures. Similar developments can also be
		    observed in other areas such as digital publishing where
		    digital technologies more and more blur the distinction
		    between communication and publishing — in both
		    directions.</li>

		<li>Coming back to the beginning of the talk  in such a
		  situation it is not necessary to sort out until the end if an
		  annotation addresses a property of a text or makes a claim
		  about it. If the connection has a reliable background we can
		  treat it as Metadata if this background falls apart we can
		  engage with it as it were an assertion besides others.
		  Intellectually we would have done it anyway. But today this
